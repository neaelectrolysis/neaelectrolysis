<h2>Participant Demographics</h2>
<p>As of April 2025, the survey has only received 11 submissions. 
There is no publicly available data on how many electrologists are located in the United States. 
<br>
<br>
Two participants stated they are located in Maryland, two reported they are located in California, 
the remaining participants reported as (one) located in Illinois, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Ohio.
<br>
<br>
One participant reported as being located in "Ncc". It's unclear what Ncc stands for, so this participant was excluded from the map. 
<br>
<br>
Of the 11 participants, 10 reported as employed and 1 reported as employed under employer/supervisor.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Reported Work Hours</h2>
<p>Participants were asked to report on the hours they work in various contexts. 
<br><br>
First participants were asked to share an estimated average of how many hours they've worked (as in performing electrolysis- hours spent on other job tasks excluded) per week
in the past 2 months. 
<br>
<!--
27.3% reported 10 to 20 hrs/week.
<br>
<br>
36.4% reported 20 to 30 hrs/week.
<br>
<br>
36.4% reported 30 to 40 hrs/week.

<br>
<br>
<p>
Next, clients were asked to share an estimate of how many hours they've spent per week on other job tasks, such as marketing and cleaning equipment.
<br>

<!--
The majority (54.6%) reported they spend 5 hours or less on these tasks per week, on average. 
<br>
<br>
27.3% reported they spend 10 hours or less on these tasks per week, on average.

<h2>Comments by Electrologists</h2>

<p>
<b>Participants were asked to share their thoughts on the job growth & demand for electrologists in the US, based on their subjective experience & observations. 
All 11 of the participants responded, and all responses regarded the job growth and/or demand as being positive.</b>
<br>
<br>

"Very high demand, many of us have been desperate for help for 5+ years now."
<br><br>
"Severe demand, most of us are booked and have waiting lists."
<br><br>
"I currently have a waitlist of about 20 people for starting electrolysis."
<br><br>
"I am the only electrologist in my area. 
Bigger cities have them but I’m in a college town. 
I have so many clients I recently put a hold on accepting new clients. 
I would say this is a huge growing career and many people are seeking it!"
<br><br>
"Wild growth"
<br><br>
"We are all stressed…. Shortage of electrologists in all of the big cities."
<br><br>
"Severe demand, most of us are booked and have waiting lists."
</p>

<p>
<b>Participants were also asked for their input on job satisfaction, and if they would encourage others to seek electrology as a career investment.</b>
<br><br>
"Yes, I love it!"
<br><br>
"Heck yah!!"
<br><br>
"Yes, if you are skilled at it."
<br><br>
"Yes. It has been a rewarding experience helping someone eliminate a source of anxiety, pain, embarrassment, and anguish."
<br><br>
"Yes. More need to join the field. Growing demand between PCOS and trans women."
<br><br>
"The demand is very high and only increasing."
<br><br>
"I have struggled with unwanted hair growth for the past many years. 
This has helped boost my confidence as well as all of my clients. 
It’s very satisfying to see the results and help people become who they truly are and want to be!"
<br><br>
"Absolutely. I love being self-employed, my job is rewarding and not stressful, 
I feel like I thrive every day at work. 
Sometimes it’s difficult to deal with all the different personalities, 
especially if you aren’t great at setting boundaries, but most people are wonderful."
<br><br>
"One has to be passionate about doing electrolysis and they need a mentor after they get their certificate. 
Many give up because they don't have a mentor. Technically, electrolysis is a harder skill to perfect well."
<br><br>
"I think it’s a great career, very satisfying to help people feel better about themselves. 
I think you have to remember when you own your own business, you’re making money minus the benefits. 
If you can find a good job as a w2 employee with good benefits, which is rare in Portland but common in 
Southern California, you’d be great. Also remember how important it is to take care of your body in this career. 
Your eyes, your back, your hands. You’re sitting all day every day. Also remember that you can do this for 10 or 
15 years and pivot. It’s okay to change careers at different times in your life. 
But Electrolysis is a great career and I say go for it!"

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Although data quality is poor, considering we've only had 11 participants--
Failed to collect data on population of their location & year they started their business
