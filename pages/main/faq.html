<button class="accordion">
What about your Service & Price Menu?</button>
<div class="panel"><br><p>
We will publish more info about our services & prices once our studio is ready to open. 
Our appointment duration & prices will be similar to local market rates.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, many electrologists offer time slots for 15-min, 30-min, 45-min, and 60-min appointments. 
Prices for appointments less than 60 min are often tiered, to account for the cost of supplies and time spent setting up & cleaning their station. 
The cost for a 60-min appointment ranges from $75-150, sometimes depending on the area of the body.
<br><br></p></div>

<button class="accordion">
What areas of the body will you work on?</button>
<div class="panel"><br><p>
NEA Electrolysis is happy to offer service on any area of the body, with respect to laws or safety/liability concerns; 
However, the service will not be offered for "Brazilian" areas until some time after opening. 
<br><br></p></div>

<button class="accordion">
Will you accept insurance?</button>
<div class="panel"><br><p>
We won't bill insurance directly, but will be prepared to offer a "super bill" if your insurance offers coverage. 
This requires clients to contact their insurance company to confirm if they offer coverage 
& if they have any special requirements to be eligible for coverage.
<br><br> 
The client first pays out of pocket at each visit, then submits the provided super bill
to their insurance, and waits to be reimbursed some or all of the service fee. 
<br><br>
With this method, NEA Electrolysis has no involvement or responsibility aside from providing an accurate super bill,
and can make no guarantee the insurance company will reimburse the client.
<br><br></p></div>

<button class="accordion">
How will I schedule an appointment once your studio is open?</button>
<div class="panel"><br><p>
We will use an online scheduling platform, this will make booking appointments (and consultations) more convenient for everyone! 
We won't require booking your appointment in advance, the software will make it clear what days & times are available.
<br><br></p></div>
