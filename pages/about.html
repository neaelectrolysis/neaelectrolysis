<h3>Who is the Name & Face Behind NEA Electrolysis LLC?</h3>

<br>

<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">My name is Autumn Dildine, born & raised in NEA. 
I recently graduated from the Electrology Institute of Wisconsin, and I'm in the process of obtaining my electrology license for Arkansas. 
I purchased an LLC for early business operations purposes, but will convert to a PLLC once I'm licensed in AR & ready to offer a professional service. 
<br><br>
In my free time, I enjoy dabbling in photography, graphic design, web design; reading, painting, and spending time with my friends & family. 
I'm so excited to be pursuing a career in electrology! 
With my passion for helping others, along with my own struggles with unwanted hair, 
this is an amazing opportunity to do my part in building a better world- in an area where interests & skills like mine is needed & appreciated. 
<br><br>
My aspiration is to provide excellent service, 
spread compassion & kindness;
advocate for equality, acceptance, improving standards & quality of care; 
and never forget there is always more to learn.
<br><br>
Everyone deserves to love themselves through each chapter of their story, and I'm honored to be part of that journey. 
<br><br><br></p>
