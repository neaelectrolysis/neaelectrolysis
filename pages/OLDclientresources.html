Some clients may struggle with skin dryness, even when they're well hydrated, which can be a problem for electrolysis treatment. 
However, this problem may also require advice from a different professional.
Below are some resources to serve as a starting point for self-education about ingredients & products for dryness.

📚The Invisible Struggle: The Psychosocial Aspects of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</a><br><br>
<p><b>Introduction and Background</b><br>
“--The invisible struggle that accompanies PCOS involves coping with societal misconceptions, 
facing stigmatization, and navigating the often complex interplay between physical and mental health. 
Recognizing and addressing these psychosocial dimensions is imperative for comprehensive, patient-centered care [3].
<br><br>
The purpose of this review is to delve into the psychosocial intricacies of PCOS, 
shedding light on the often-overlooked aspects that significantly impact the lives of those affected.--”
<br><br>
<b>Body Image Issues and Self Esteem</b><br>
“PCOS has profound effects on body image and self-esteem, as individuals may contend with physical 
symptoms such as weight gain, acne, and hirsutism. Societal beauty standards often exacerbate these 
challenges, perpetuating unrealistic expectations that can be particularly distressing for individuals 
with PCOS. The visible manifestations of the syndrome can lead to a negative self-perception and, 
in some cases, contribute to the development of eating disorders. A comprehensive understanding of 
the impact of PCOS on body image is essential for implementing supportive interventions that address 
both the physical and psychological aspects of well-being [13].”

<h4>Summary of Medicines Used for Treatment & Other Topics</h4>

📚Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (OASH)</a>
<br><br>
<p>** The concern for endometrial cancer in PCOS is due to irregular or absent periods. 
If the uterine lining isn’t shedding often enough, this increases risk for endometrial cancer. 
<br><br>
A hormonal contraceptive containing a progestin (synthetic progesterone) is recommended 
when a certain threshold for irregularity in menses is met, for individuals with an intact uterus. 
Such as a progestin-only pill (POP); or combination birth control (COCP) which contains both 
a progestin & ethinyl estradiol; or non-pill forms such as the IUD, patch, shot (most of which are progestin-only).
<br><br>
Ethinyl estradiol, found in hormonal contraceptives, isn’t necessary for reducing risk of 
endometrial cancer; However, this is the primary synthetic hormone in this drug class 
that helps with managing hyperandrogenism in PCOS. 
<br><br>
There are a variety of progestins available for hormonal contraceptives. Most progestins 
have varying androgenic effects; but at this time, no particular hormonal contraceptive 
is recommended due to lack of evidence-based data on the clinical implications of different 
progestins for individuals with hyperandrogenism or PCOS. Drospirenone is available in COCPs 
and as a POP (Slynd). This is the only progestin available in a progestin-only pill that has 
mild anti-androgenic properties.
<br><br>
** Vaniqa (topical eflornithine cream) was discontinued in the U.S. However, a different 
brand may be available or may be filled at a compounding pharmacy if prescribed. 
It’s recommended to check with your health insurance if this prescribed cream is covered. 
The online company Musely also sells a product containing eflornithine, but it’s a lesser 
concentration than the prescribed form. It is NOT recommended to apply this product on areas 
undergoing electrolysis treatment for permanent hair removal.</p><br><br>
