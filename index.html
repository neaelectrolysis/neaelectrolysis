<h3>A Little About Me:</h3>

<p>
My name is Autumn Dildine, I'm 28 years old and was born & raised in Northeast Arkansas.
I'm so excited for my upcoming career in electrology;
I've always had an interest in science & medicine, 
and with electrology being adjacent to healthcare & cosmetics, it wasn't hard to choose this path!

<br><br>
I love helping people, and have interests in studying PCOS & related topics. 
I'm no stranger to the challenges people face with unwanted hair & dysphoria.
In my free time, I enjoy various art-related hobbies, reading, cooking, watching scifi movies, spending time with my family, and playing minecraft. 

<br><br>
One of my ambitions in life is to do my part in building a world that's more accepting of ourselves & each other. 
It's my hope that future generations grow up blessed with a stronger set of skills to accept & love themselves, in spite of their differences; 
what so many of us have spent a large part of our adulthood catching up on. 

<br><br>
Always remember, you deserve to love yourself & feel confident through every chapter of your journey!

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>

<button class="accordion">What do you expect your pricing to be?</button>
<div class="panel">
<br>
<p>
Pricing hasn't been fully decided yet, I expect it to range from $40-$175, depending on the length of the session. 
<br><br>
A $25 nonrefundable fee is required at the time of booking a consultation, this will be needed before booking a session. 
If 5 sessions (of any length) are completed within the first 6 months after consultation, the $25 fee will be credited towards your 6th session.
<br><br>
A 25% deposit is required at the time of booking any session. 
This deposit is nonrefundable unless the session is canceled/rescheduled 3 days in advance.
</p>
<br>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What areas of the body will you work on?</button>
<div class="panel">
<br>
<p>
I'm only a student & haven't begun practical training yet, 
so this question isn't easy for me to answer; since I have alot to learn about ergonomics, positioning, & technique.
However, I don't have any personal limits with working on any area of the body or any gender, 
as long as it aligns with the standards/regulations for electrolysis! 
</p>
<br>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How will I book a session, once you're open for business?</button>
<div class="panel">
<br>
<p>
I plan to use an online scheduling software, 
this will make booking sessions (and consultations) more convenient for everyone and show what days & times I'm available. 
I won't specifically require booking your session any set amount of days in advance, the software will take care of that!
</p>
<br>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Will you offer discounts?</button>
<div class="panel">
<br>
<p>
I plan to offer discounts, but exact details haven't been decided yet. 
It's recommended not to extend the length of sessions beyond 15 or 30 minutes for the first 1-3 sessions, to better assess skin sensitivity & other factors. 
In light of this, I need more time to decide what kind of system would work best for everyone!
<br><br>
I also plan to offer a referral rewards incentive discount!
</p>

<h3>Electrologist Survey (United States) 2025</h3>

<p>In 2025 I released a survey, asking electrologists to share information about their careers, 
with the objective to collect data to assess current job growth & demand, 
and help determine whether becoming an electrologist is a good career investment.
Besides the results of my survey, the only data I could find on electrology was lumped in with other professions under "Skincare Specialists", 
on the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/skincare-specialists.htm#:~:text=Employment%20of%20skincare%20specialists%20is,Similar%20Occupations"><b>US Bureau of Labor Statistics</b></a> website.
</p>

if you're an electrologist and wish to participate in the survey! 
It takes about 10-15 minutes & submissions are anonymous unless you choose to share your email at the end. 
</p>

<h3>Coming Later This Year:</h3>
<p>I'm also working on another survey that I haven't released yet, the objective is to collect data on the psychological impact of hyperandrogenism in cisgender women with PCOS.
The results will be published here when it's ready to share!
