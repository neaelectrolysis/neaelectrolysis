<!--

fix navbar so the texts stay in a horizontal line on mobile 
add NEA ELECTROLYSIS log on navbar on faq & about page (figure out how to get to display in center)
edit css for links (underlining & highlighting)
edit css for footer
customize the sign up button
move the position of the button & the "permanent hair removal" phrase


figure out why there was a space between navbar and background image on desktop. had to fix it with margin-top but there wasn't a space issue on mobile so margin-top was just 0px

need to make sure seo works or add text

i think i want to remove the icon on navbar on other pages and instead use neaelectrolysis logo

for the next update (on home page) i want the background photo to remain static and the text/paragraphs have transparent white backgrounds with round corners

why isn't the footer showing on my index page on mobile

and why is there so much space above/under the footer on other pages

<h3>What is Electrolysis?</h3>
<p>Electrolysis is the only method FDA approved for permanent hair removal. 
Unlike laser hair removal, electrolysis works on every skin tone & hair type. 
Laser definitely has its place in the industry, 
while electrolysis helps meet the needs of clients when laser isn't suitable for their goals.
<br><br>
During electrolysis, a disposable, sterilized wire filament (probe) 
is inserted into the hair follicle before a small amount of electric current 
is delivered. After applying current, the electrologist gently removes the hair 
with tweezers. The goal of electrolysis is to destroy the stem cells that play 
an essential role in hair growth, located in the lower 2/3rds of the follicle. 
The three main methods of electrolysis are Thermolysis, Galvanic, and The Blend Method. 
If your electrologist offers all 3 of these methods, 
they choose which best fits your needs when deciding your treatment plan.
<br><br>
Thermolysis uses a high frequency current, also known as AC (alternating current). 
This is similar to the current radios, wifi, and microwaves use. 
Thermolysis causes the water molecules within the tissues surrounding the hair 
shaft to vibrate, which produces heat. When enough heat is produced, Thermolysis 
damages the cells responsible for hair growth. Thermolysis typically involves 
applying current less than 1 second per follicle. 
<br><br>
Galvanic uses "galvanic" current, also known as DC (direct current). 
This type of current is used by batteries. 
Galvanic produces a chemical reaction between the sodium & water in the tissues 
surrounding the hair shaft. This creates sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, 
which damages the cells responsible for hair growth. The duration of current 
varies greatly for galvanic, depending on the hair type and other factors. 
For instance, a coarse hair may require roughly 6 to 25 seconds to achieve the desired effect.
<br><br>
The Blend Method is a combination of both Thermolysis & Galvanic. 
This method is slower than Thermolysis, but faster than Galvanic. 
Combining these two currents helps each of them work better. 
For instance, heat improves the effectiveness of lye, 
which reduces the amount of lye required for the desired effect.
