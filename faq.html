  <b>Q: What services do you offer?</b>
  <br>
  A: I offer electrolysis hair removal on nearly all areas of the body, and I also offer advanced electrolysis. 
  For hair removal, I only charge based on time, my price is the same no matter what area of the body. 
  For advanced electrolysis, the price differs depending on the service.
  <a href="service.html"><b>Click here for more information on Services & Prices.</b></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: What do I need to do before a consultation?</b>
  <br>
  A: Clients must complete & submit the online documents I send before consultation. Clients should be clean, wear comfortable clothes-
  keeping in mind I'll be examining the area they're seeking services for,   
  discuss treatment goals, expectations, medical history, your current skincare routine. Consultations generally take 15-30 minutes to complete. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: What payment methods do you accept?</b>
  <br>
  A: I accept cash, debit cards, credit cards. 
  <br>
  <br>
   <b>Q: When is payment due?</b>
  <br>
  A: The consultation fee ($25.00 + tax)is due at the time of booking your consultation, and a 25% deposit is always due at the time of booking a session. 
  If you book your session or consultation through <a href="BOOK SESSION LINK"><b>this platform</b></a>, payment is easy & convenient. 
  If you schedule in-person or over the phone, I'll send you an invoice that must be payed by the end of the day. 
  <br>
  <br>
   <b>Q: How long will it take to see results from electrolysis?</b>
  <br>
  A: This is a very challenging to answer. The rate of improvement varies wildly depending on the area being treated, 
  the underlying cause of the unwanted hair--
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: If I stop electrolysis, will that ruin my progress?</b>
  <br>
  A: Electrolysis is the only FDA approved PERMANENT hair removal method. When a skilled electrologist performs electrolysis properly, the follicle is dead forever. It will never grow back!
  Taking a break from electrolysis sessions won't ruin your progress, it will just delay the time it takes to reach your goals. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: Policy on client's privacy</b>
  <br>
  A: As a licensed electrologist, it's my duty to protect your PHI (personal health information) and I must follow HIPAA rules. 
  I will never share the contents of your PHI that I have on file, or even the fact that you're my client, unless you submit a written request. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: How long does a session take?</b>
  <br>
  A: The length of your session depends on the area being treated, client's pain tolerance
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: Is electrolysis painful?</b>
  <br>
  A: Yes, electrolysis can be painful. Clients' pain tolerance varies. During consultation, I'll discuss products you can use during sessions to help ease pain/discomfort. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: Do you accept health insurance?</b>
  <br>
  A: I currently don't accept health insurance, but that's something I hope to offer in the future!
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: What days & times can I schedule a session?</b>
  <br>
  A: I'm available for sessions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, & Sunday from 1pm-6pm. 
  I encourage clients to share what days/times work best for THEM while filling out consultation paperwork, 
  so I can know if there's a greater need to alter my schedule to better accomodate clients.

	<!-- skincare, what to expect, help! is this reaction normal? -->
	
	
  <b>Q: What do I need to do on or before the day of my session?</b>
  <br>
  A: Clients need to be clean, wear comfortable clothing, well hydrated, and have stopped shaving so the hair is around 1/4 inch length. 
  I recommend clients trim with electric hair clippers + guard before our session, if the hair is longer than 1/2 inch in length. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: What do I need to do after my sessions?</b>
  <br>
  A: Clients should avoid taking hot showers/baths, avoid exfoliation, follow aftercare rules. 
  Following electrolysis for hair removal, some mild redness is expected & should resolve within 24 hours.
  Keep in mind this is not a comprehensive list, I discuss this more in-depth during our consultation, 
  and clients are aways welcome to reach out to me if they have more questions!
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: How do I get a discount on services?</b>
  <br>
  A: I offer a referral discount for current clients that refer their friends to me for services!
  <a href="referraldiscount.html"><b>Click here for more information.</b></a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: How do I contact you outside of sessions?</b>
  <br>
  A: The best way to reach me is by phone (texting/calling) 424-261-2181. You can also email me (neaelectrolysis@gmail.com) or message me on FB messenger. 
  I'm out-of-office on Thursday, Friday, Saturday- please leave me a voicemail or text so I know to contact you when I'm in the office.

<button class="accordion">Other Questions</button>
<div class="panel">
  <h4>
  <b>Q: Do you require a deposit?</b>
  <br>
  A: The consultation fee ($25.00 + tax)is due the the time of booking your consultation, and a 25% deposit is always due at the time of booking a session. 
  If you book your session or consultation through <a href="BOOK SESSION LINK"><b>this portal</b></a>, payment is easy & convenient. 
  If you schedule in-person or over the phone, I'll send you an invoice that must be payed by the end of the day. 
  
  
  I understand life happens and sometimes we miss appointments for reasons out of our control.
  My policy is the consultation fee is non-refundable when client failes to follow my cancelation/rescheduling policy, 
  but I welcome you to book the consultation a 2nd time, free of charge. 
  The 25% deposit is refundable up to (2) times per client, and then following the 2nd incident 
  in which you miss a session or fail to follow my rescheduling-policy, the 25% deposit is nonrefundable.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: What is your policy on rescheduling/cancelations & refunds?</b>
  <br>
  A: Clients must reschedule or cancel their consultation/session 2 weeks before the scheduled date, in order to be eligible for a refund.
  <br>
  I understand life happens & sometimes we miss appts for reasons out of our control. 
  If a client failes to follow the terms of my rescheduling/cancelation policy, the client is only eligible for a refund if:
  <br>
  <br>
  1. The consultation fee is never refundable, but clients are welcome to book a 2nd consultation, free of charge. 
  <br>
  <br>
  2. A client is eligible for a refund on their 25% deposit a total of (2) times. 
  If the client fails to follow my rescheduling/cancelation policy a 3rd time & following, the 25% deposit is not refundable. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Please understand the purpose of these policies is to help myself & all of my clients make the most of our time, 
  and also protect my business from lost income due to repeat cancelations.
  <br>
  <br>

<b>Q: Help! Is this reaction normal?</b>
  <br>
  A: First of all, I hope none of my clients ever need this section of the FAQ. 
  However, with electrolysis for hair removal, it's normal to experience some mild redness that should resolve within 24 hours. 
  If a client ever has an abnormal reaction, please reach out to me ASAP
